= Notes

These are some notes about PythonConsole.com.

I bought the domain from namecheap.com. I thought about using pybook.ml from FreeNom but
that seemed a bit sketchy.

Hosting is Vultr VPS. The ansible playbook commands work to keep it setup and up to date.

Domain email is handled through an add-on with namecheap, goes through privateemail.com.

Signups are handled with MailJet.
