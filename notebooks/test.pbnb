You can also have cells that have "submit" buttons. These run Python code and
can respond based on the text that is submitted.

#% user language=text id=submit1
Enter something here

#% submit
print(f"You typed {__input}")

#% test
print(__source['submit1'])
cell=__cells['submit1']
print(cell)
print(cell['user'])
