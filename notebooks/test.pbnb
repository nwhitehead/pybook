# Code cells can have multiple expressions. Each value is shown, unless the
# result is None in which case nothing is shown. This is consistent with the
# behavior of the Python REPL.

# You can also print to stdout, which shows up in the output area.
print("Hello from PyBook")

# There is one Python state. It will be affected by each cell you evaluate.
# Try evaluating this cell and the next one in different orders.

print(f'x is {x}, y is {y}')

You can also have cells that have "submit" buttons. These run Python code and
can respond based on the text that is submitted.

#% user language=text id=submit1
Enter something here

#% submit
print(f"You typed {__input}")

#% test
cell=__cells['submit1']
print(cell)
print(__user['submit1'])
