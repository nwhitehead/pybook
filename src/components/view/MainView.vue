        <h2>Python Console</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="#/console">Python Console</a> is an online Python interpreter that runs entirely in your browser.
            It lets you quickly try out Python ideas while being as similar to the normal Python command line interpreter as possible.
            No setup needed. Packages automatically install when you import them.
        </p>
        <h2>Python Editor</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="#/code">Python Editor</a> is a simple Python development environment. It has a program editor on the left side,
            and a Python console on the right side. Press the "Play" button to execute your code and see the results in the console. You can
            also interact directly with the Python console.
